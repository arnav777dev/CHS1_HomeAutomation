The idea of Home Automation emerges as a beacon of inclusive design. This project aims to revolutionize the interaction between individuals and their home environments. By seamlessly integrating gesture recognition technology, it facilitates effortless control of various home devices through simple hand movements. By this project, we aim to have an innovative approach that not only marks a significant leap forward in smart home design but also addresses the challenge of accessibility, ensuring that the benefits of automation are extended to users of all ages, especially catering to the needs of senior citizens. By this project, we would work on establishing a robust Home Automation system for various home appliances be it Chimneys, Geysers, TVs and many more .
